/**
 * How this copy of the app is signed, probed once at boot and reported on the
 * launch analytics event. The interesting failure: an ad-hoc signature's
 * designated requirement is a bare content hash, and macOS keys every privacy
 * grant (Documents, Desktop, …) to that requirement — so each update of an
 * ad-hoc build silently resets the user's grants. This field makes a bad
 * release observable within hours instead of via user complaints.
 *
 * Never throws and never outlasts timeoutMs: a diagnostic must not be able to
 * delay or break startup. Any failure degrades to 'unknown'.
